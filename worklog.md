Task ID: 1
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Phase 1 — Foundation (Shared Types + API Utils + Constants)

Work Log:
- Analyzed all 22+ files that import from app-store.ts for backward compatibility
- Created src/types/index.ts — centralized all shared types (CurrencyCode, CURRENCY_MAP, User, CartItem, HeldOrder, SettingsState, Screen, InvoiceData, TemplateType, Lang, etc.)
- Created src/types/api.ts — unified API response types (ApiResponse, ApiErrorResponse, PaginatedResponse, type guards, PaginationQuery)
- Created src/lib/api-response.ts — helper functions (successResponse, errorResponse, notFound, unauthorized, forbidden, serverError, validationError, paginatedResponse, parseBody)
- Created src/lib/constants.ts — centralized constants (DEFAULT_SETTINGS, ITEMS_PER_PAGE, MAX_HELD_ORDERS, DEBOUNCE_MS, persist keys)
- Updated store/app-store.ts — removed inline types/constants, imports from @/types and @/lib/constants, re-exports everything for backward compatibility (22+ files still work)
- Updated lib/print-templates.ts — imports InvoiceData/TemplateType from @/types instead of defining locally
- Updated lib/translations.ts — imports Lang from @/types, uses LANGUAGE_PERSIST_KEY from constants
- Updated hooks/use-currency.ts — imports CurrencyDisplayMode from @/types instead of defining locally
- Fixed TypeScript type error in PaginatedResponse (was extending ApiResponse incorrectly)
- Verified: npx tsc --noEmit = 0 errors
- Verified: bun run lint = 0 errors
- Verified: Dev server starts, Page=200, Login=200, Products=200, Dashboard=200

Stage Summary:
- 4 new files created (types/index.ts, types/api.ts, lib/api-response.ts, lib/constants.ts)
- 4 existing files updated (app-store.ts, print-templates.ts, translations.ts, use-currency.ts)
- Zero breaking changes — all 22+ importers still work via re-exports
- TypeScript: 0 errors, ESLint: 0 errors
- All API endpoints functional

---
Task ID: 2
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Phase 2 — Auth + Users APIs (bcrypt + JWT + middleware)

Work Log:
- Installed bcryptjs, jose, @types/bcryptjs
- Created src/lib/auth.ts — centralized auth library (hashPassword, verifyPassword, generateToken, verifyToken, extractToken, getAuthUser)
- Created src/lib/auth-middleware.ts — withAuth wrapper, requireAdmin, setAuthCookie, clearAuthCookie, getRequestUser
- Updated src/app/api/auth/route.ts — now uses bcrypt verifyPassword, generates JWT token, sets HTTP-only cookie, supports plaintext→hash migration
- Created src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts — session verification endpoint
- Created src/app/api/auth/seed-passwords/route.ts — one-time migration to hash all plaintext passwords
- Updated src/app/api/users/route.ts — GET/POST now protected with withAuth + requireAdmin, passwords auto-hashed on create
- Created src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts — PUT/DELETE with proper REST URL params, admin-only, passwords auto-hashed on update
- Created src/middleware.ts — blanket JWT verification for all /api/* routes (allows /api/auth, /_next, static)
- Updated src/store/app-store.ts — added token to auth state, login now accepts (user, token), persisted to localStorage
- Updated src/screens/login-screen.tsx — passes token from login response to store
- Updated src/screens/users-screen.tsx — fixed 3 fetch calls to use /api/users/${id} for PUT/DELETE
- Added JWT_SECRET to .env file
- Executed seed-passwords: hashed 2 passwords (admin, cashier)
- Fixed DATABASE_URL system env override issue (SQLite default was interfering)

Verified:
- TypeScript: 0 errors
- ESLint: 0 errors
- 14 comprehensive auth tests ALL PASSED
- Login (admin) → 200 + JWT token ✅
- Login (cashier) → 200 + JWT token ✅

- 11 API endpoints with valid token → all 200 ✅
- Main page (public) → 200 ✅
- Seed-passwords idempotent → 0 re-hashed ✅
- Dev log: 0 server errors (500)

Stage Summary:

- 5 existing files updated (auth/route.ts, users/route.ts, app-store.ts, login-screen.tsx, users-screen.tsx)
- Complete auth system: bcrypt hashing, JWT tokens, HTTP-only cookies, Edge middleware, role-based access
- Backward compatible: login still works for plaintext passwords during migration
- All APIs now protected by default — middleware blocks unauthenticated requests
